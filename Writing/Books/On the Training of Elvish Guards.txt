On the Training of Elvish Guards (Originally Elvish)

	This fighting style, being less lethal than most others described in my manuscripts, is considered primarily as a method for town guards and law enforcement. It has been specifically designed for advancing upon crowds and dealing minimal harm while still significantly protecting the user. Of course, if used by a skilled warrior, this technique could be turned lethal in an instant.
	The equipment needed consists of a custom-sized and thin shield, spanning from fist to elbow., and a short sword with no fuller and heavy pommel. Then, when an advance begins, the soldier aligns the shield, elbow facing foreword, between their shoulder and their head. This way half of the face is covered and the head is protected from projectiles.
	The smith I know who is skilled enough to make such a specific shield goes by the name of Tyris. He can be found in the Old Quarter of the Elvish capital, but he spends his summers on pilgrimage in the West.
